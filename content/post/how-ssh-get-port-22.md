A nice story from SSH creator (Tatu Ylonen) about how [SSH got its port 22](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/port).

Briefly, initial SSH version was created in Spring 1995, time when FTP and Telnet were widely used. SSH was designed to replace FTP (port 21) and Telnet (port 23). Port 22 was free. 
So it was chosen to be used in SSH. At that time Internet was small, and port numbers were allocated by IANA, managed by Internet pioneers Jon Postel and Joyce K. Reynolds. 
Tatu wrote an email to IANA with request to use port 22, and got port 22 assigned to SSH in the response email! 
Wow! Great! More read here: [https://www.ssh.com/ssh/port](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/port).
