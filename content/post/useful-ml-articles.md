I have got a list of useful ML articles from ODS slack ([message link](https://opendatascience.slack.com/archives/C047H3N8L/p1520445318000067)).

<!--more-->

Brief context: there was a task to study a person with almost zero programming experience and absolutely absent ML knowledge 
to become able to do ML research. So, how it was achieved? Simple! This person was charged to implement all articles from the list 
using `pytorch`. It took almost a month for the person to learn to read, implement and sometimes analyze articles from the list. 

So here is this list:
