Let's consider how to publish some static content on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) so that it will be served as a website. 
There are 2 ways to publish it:
 
* As user/organizational site
* As project site

What is the difference

## User/organizational site

So you have an account on Github, let it be names `mightyjohn`. You may have only one user site, that will be kept in a special repository names `mightyjohn.github.io`. 
If you want to have such site, first you must create this special repo named `mightyjohn.github.io`. There is nothing special in it, except it predefined name.

Then you put content in this repo, which will be served as a website. The content is published only from `master` branch!
